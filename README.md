# Performance-Review
Performance Review app
This was my final project from my web-development bootcamp at Brainstation. It is a tool designed to help the average person objectively evaluate their mutual fund performance.
The scale is limited due to time constraints for the project and acts more as a proof of concept.
The app includes a full description of what information is being presented and how it is best used.
